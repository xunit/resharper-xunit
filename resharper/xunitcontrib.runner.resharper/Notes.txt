TODO:

Resharper + xunit - XunitFileExplorer

1. ProcessBeforeInterior - refactor to split into ProcessDeclaredElement
2. Either have ProcessTestClass add all test methods, or just have ProcessTestMethod add them - don't try and do both
3. Where does the output from the Theory tests come from?
4. Get Theory tests to display with parameter information
5. Get Theory tests to display as different to normal tests - multiple? different icon?
6. Nested test should display nested name? nunit doesn't
